Description: A general framework to infer regulatory mechanisms from multi-omics single-cell data. 
    HuMMuS package provides functions to build individual networks
    from different single-cell modalities, then to integrate them 
    into a single-cell heterogeneous multilayer network. The package
    also provides functions to infer regulatory mechanisms from the
    heterogeneous multilayer network.
    HuMMuS is based on a flexible framework that can be adapted to any 
    single-cell modalities. We provide study cases for scRNA+scATAC
    and scRNA+scATAC+snmC(methylation) that can be completed by PPI.
    Many regulatory mechanisms can be inferred with HuMMuS, notably
    classical gene regulatory networks (GRN), but TF-target genes, 
    enhancer-gene interactions, TF-enhancer bindings, or even research 
    of heterogeneous communnities of omics features (e.g. ensemble of
    peaks, genes and TFs cooperating to the same biological function).
